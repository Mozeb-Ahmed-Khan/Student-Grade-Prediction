# Student Grade Prediction using Assessment Scores

This project aims to predict whether students will "pass" or "fail" before their Mid-II and Final exams based on their performance in assignments, quizzes, and exams. The dataset contains anonymized assessment scores from seven different sheets (D1 to D7) with varying numbers of assignments and quizzes.

## Key Objectives

- **Phase I:** Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand and preprocess the data.
- **Phase II:** Train models using Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree classifiers, and report results using performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

## Tools & Languages

- Python
- R
- Weka
- Orange

## Research Questions

- **RQ-1:** How accurately can we predict students' grades before the Mid-II exam?
- **RQ-2:** How accurately can we predict students' grades before the Final exam?

## Dataset

The dataset includes anonymized student assessment scores:
- Assignments
- Quizzes
- Mid-I and Mid-II exams
- Final grade predictor

Each sheet (D1 to D7) contains a different number of assignments and quizzes. Only the best 5 assignments and quizzes are included in the final calculations for predicting grades.

## Expected Outputs

- **Phase I:** Data analysis reports, charts, and tables.
- **Phase II:** Model results including confusion matrices, performance metrics, and visualizations.
